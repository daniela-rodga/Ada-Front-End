            <p>
                Cappuccino (born June 27) is a male puppy living in the house with the red roof across the street from Café Cinnamon. He likes to go at his own pace, eat a lot, and take naps. Cappuccino is easy to recognize by his mouth, which is just like a cup of cappuccino, and likes eating, but his favorite thing of all is napping. He is the glutton of the bunch and very chubby. He also loves bug catching which is his favorite activity. When Coco and Nuts were introduced in 2007, Cappuccino became a brother and looks out for the duo.

            <p>
                Mocha (born February 20) is a female puppy living in a white house on top of a hill. She's a stylish chatterbox and also the "big sister" of the bunch, always looking out for others. Mocha is known for her silky chocolate-brown fur and her pink bows with flowers. She has a crush on Cinnamon and loves fashion and getting dressed up but doesn’t like bell peppers or bugs. She is the girly girl of the group. In the Manga, Mocha's fur color is light brown and she is seen wearing different hair accessories besides her pink flowers. Alongside Chiffon and Azuki, they make up the three-girl idol group Cinnamonangels and the leader of the group.

    <h2>Rename</h2>
    <p>
        When he was first created by Sanrio in 2001, he was called Baby Cinnamon. A year later he was "renamed" Cinnamoroll, to remedy any problems with the registration of the mark overseas, however, he is now called in both ways, but also more simply Cinnamon. As of 2007, Cinnamoroll's original name "Baby Cinnamon" is no longer being used by Sanrio and is officially called "Cinnamoroll". In Japan, he is still named "Cinnamoroll" but he is mostly called "Cinnamon".
