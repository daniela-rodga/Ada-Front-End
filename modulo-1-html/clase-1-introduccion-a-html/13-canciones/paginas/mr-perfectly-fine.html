    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>Mr. "Perfect face"</p>
    <p>Mr. "Here to stay"</p>
    <p>Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"</p>
    <p>Everything was right</p>
    <p>Mr. "I've been waiting for you all my life"</p>
    <p>Mr. "Every single day until the end, I will be by your side"</p>
    <p>But that was when I got to know Mr. "Change of heart"</p>
    <p>Mr. "Leaves me all alone, " I fall apart</p>
    <p>It takes everything in me just to get up each day</p>
    <p>But it's wonderful to see that you're okay</p>
    <p>Hello Mr. "Perfectly fine"</p>
    <p>How's your heart after breaking mine?</p>
    <p>Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time, " baby</p>
    <p>Hello Mr. "Casually cruel"</p>
    <p>Mr. "Everything revolves around you"</p>
    <p>I've been Miss "Misery" since your goodbye</p>
    <p>And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"</p>
    <p>Mr. "Never told me why"</p>
    <p>Mr. "Never had to see me cry"</p>
    <p>Mr. "Insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy"</p>
    <p>He goes about his day</p>
    <p>Forgets he ever even heard my name</p>
    <p>Well, I thought you might be different than the rest</p>
    <p>I guess you're all the same</p>
    <p>'Cause I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl</p>
    <p>I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her</p>
    <p>And I never got past what you put me through</p>
    <p>But it's wonderful to see that it never phased you</p>
    <p>Hello Mr. "Perfectly fine"</p>
    <p>How's your heart after breakin' mine?</p>
    <p>Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time, " baby</p>
    <p>Hello Mr. "Casually cruel"</p>
    <p>Mr. "Everything revolves around you"</p>
    <p>I've been Miss "Misery" since your goodbye</p>
    <p>And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"</p>
    <p>So dignified in your well-pressed suit</p>
    <p>So strategized, all the eyes on you</p>
    <p>Sashay away to your seat</p>
    <p>It's the best seat, in the best room</p>
    <p>Oh, he's so smug, Mr. "Always wins"</p>
    <p>So far above me in every sense</p>
    <p>So far above feeling anything</p>
    <p>And it's really such a shame</p>
    <p>It's such a shame</p>
    <p>'Cause I was Miss "Here to stay"</p>
    <p>Now I'm Miss "Gonna be alright someday"</p>
    <p>And someday maybe you'll miss me</p>
    <p>But by then, you'll be Mr. "Too late"</p>
    <p>Goodbye Mr. "Perfectly fine"</p>
    <p>How's your heart after breakin' mine?</p>
    <p>Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time, " baby</p>
    <p>Goodbye Mr. "Casually cruel"</p>
    <p>Mr. "Everything revolves around you"</p>
    <p>I've been Miss "Misery" for the last time</p>
    <p>And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"</p>
    <p>You're perfectly fine</p>
    <p>Mr. "Look me in the eye and told me you would never go away"</p>
    <p>You said you'd never go away</p>
